## Clock ‚è∞

[Live Preview](https://im-ashish00.github.io/js-clock)

#### Things Learned:-

- transform rotate ( while trying to figure out how hands would move ).
- transform-origin ( when I didn't know how to move the hands from the same origin ).
- Getting values in degrees for minute, hour and minutes. 
- cubic-bezier ( to give clock the tik tok effect ).
